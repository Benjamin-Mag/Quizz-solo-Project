Hey , That's not a QuizZ !

Welcome to your game. 

A cool one level Game. Perfect for Poopoo Time. 
It's really not responsive !
No sound, it won't cover your "plop", you should put some music.

- Created with a super complicated Grid System. 
- Using the last generation 2D physic engine for a life-like experience 
- No LogOut button... who cares about those buttons.. 
- But you can resfre.. restart your game !
- Using DOM Manipulation because we love it Wild ! grrrR
- Our CSS file is a real piece of art itself (please don't touch it, it could possibly result opening a black hole somewhere) 
- The ball is kinda predictible... be advise :)
- You can chose your own difficulty level (not really)

Thanks for playing :)
